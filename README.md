# Magic-Palette
Orchestrate art like never before! Wave your wand (in this case, a toothbrush or a bottle) in the air to paint on your digital canvas!


When running the mobileNet SSD for object detection, run real_time_object_detection.py and move a wine bottle as your magic wand to draw something out. When Running YOLO for object detection, run yolo_real_time.py and move a toothbrush as your magic wand to draw something!
